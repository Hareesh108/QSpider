            166 people, including security personnel, lost their lives in the
            tragic events while the National Security Guard (NSG) and Mumbai
            Police shot and killed nine terrorists. Ajmal Kasab, the only
            terrorist found alive, was found guilty and given the death penalty.
            On November 21, 2012, Kasab was hanged, five days prior the 26/11
            attack's fourth anniversary. Following the attacks, a number of
            politicians resigned, including Vilasrao Deshmukh, the chief
            minister of Maharashtra, and Shivraj Patil, the then-Union home
            minister.

          <p>
            Here's a brief timeline of events occured during four-day-long
            attack:
            <br /><b>26/11:</b><br />
            Ten terrorists from the Lashkar-e-Taiba arrive in Mumbai by
            speedboat from Karachi. First reports from the city start coming in
            late at night. Although the initial reports refer to a "gang war,"
            it soon became evident that it is a terrorist attack. Two terrorists
            enter the Trident, two more enter the Taj, and four more enter the
            Nariman House. The other two, including Kasab, start shooting at the
            CSMT, leaving 58 people dead and more than 100 injured. Then Kasab
            and Ismail Khan make their way to the Cama Hospital. They attack six
            police officers en route, including Ashok Kamte, Vijay Salaskar, and
            the former head of the Mumbai Anti-Terror Squad (ATS), Hemant
            Karkare. The two then flees in the jeep driven by the officers, but
            the Mumbai Police catch them. Khan is killed in the ongoing
            firefight, and Kasab is taken into custody. Policeman Tukaram Ombale
            is killed in the line of duty. <br />
            <b>27/11:</b><br />
            The Taj, Trident, and Nariman House are surrounded by Army troops
            and Marine commandos . Launching Operation Black Tornado is the
            elite NSG, which has been sent to strike the sites. <br /><b
              >28/11:</b
            ><br />
            The Trident and Nariman House operations are completed by commandos
            on November 28. 29/11 The National Security Guard secures the Taj,
            ending the attacks.
